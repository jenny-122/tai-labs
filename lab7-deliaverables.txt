Goal & Outcomes

Lab Overview

Experimental Setup

    •Devices: Pixel 7/8 (preferred) or laptop CPU

    •Software: MLC-LLM, Perfetto (for Android device), or other energy/power profiling tools.

    •Environment control: fix brightness, use Wi-Fi connection, close unrelated apps, fix CPU/GPU frequency.

Controlling Prompt and Generation Tokens

    •PT (Prompt Tokens). You can ask ChatGPT to help you generate the prompts with different length.

        •prompt_64  = "What is AI?"                # ~10 tokens

        •prompt_256 = "Explain the history, key methods, and modern advances in AI." * 5

        •prompt_512 = "Explain..." * 10

    •GT (Generated Tokens)

        •max_new_tokens

        •Example:

        •outputs = model.generate(prompt, max_new_tokens=64)

Data Collection Procedure

    •Select PT ∈ {64, 256, 512, 1024}, GT ∈ {16, 64, 128}.

    •Run inference 3 times per setting.

    •Measure energy (mJ) and latency (s).

    •Record in CSV: PT, GT, Energy(mJ), Latency(s).

Simple Energy Predictor

Visualization

    •Show plots:

        Energy vs PT for fixed GT

        Energy vs GT for fixed PT

        Predicted vs Measured Energy

        Tools: matplotlib.

Deliverables

    •Submission deadline: 10/31/2025 11:59 PM.

    •Submit:

        Code notebook (.ipynb)

        Result CSV (energy data)

        1–2 page report with plots and discussion.
